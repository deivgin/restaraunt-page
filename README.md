## Motivations

This website was created mainly to practice project set up, folder structure, naming and creating elements with js. It is a super simple website, there could be more added. For example the home page is lacking content and good design principles, there should be more animations and functionality. More work could be done on it, but since this is a simple course project ill leave it how it is, maby in the future it will get updated.
